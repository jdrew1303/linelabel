A simple, no-dependency library for breaking a path into chunks that have a desired level of straightness (defined by max curvature). The main use for this is text labeling in SVGs and web maps.

```sh
$ npm install linelabel --save
```

For performance reasons, the package comes with two variations of the same function:

```js
// if your coordinates look like this: [0, 0]
var linelabel = require('linelabel');

// if your coordinates look like this: {x: 0, y: 0}
var linelabel = require('linelabel/xy');
```

### Usage

```js
var segments = linelabel(pts, max_angle);
```

The `max_angle` argument represents the maximum angle delta to allow between three points (in radians). If the angle differs more than the given amount, the current chunk will be ended and a new one will start. The output will be an array of segments, each looking like:

```js
{
	length: <number>,
	beginIndex: <number>,
	beginDistance: <number>,
	endIndex: <number>,
	endDistance: <number>,
	angles: <number[]> /* curvature at each point in the segment */
}
```
